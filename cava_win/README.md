so it has come to this, but why not


to make it build install sdl2, fftw (not libfftw), pthreads and optinally glew via the nuget thing. Or just hack them in anyway you like. 
it's windows, so by the time you read this it's probably a new and even worse way to do it.

All paths are configure relativly to the project, but might stop workiong at some point.

install Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 

for sdl_glsl output install glew (via nuget) add SDL_GLSL definition and pray to deity of choice
